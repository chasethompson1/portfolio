        Hi everyone, my name is Chase Thompson and I'm a junior at Ottumwa High School.
        I took this class to try out the Computer Software Program here at IHCC. I'm 
        not going to lie, it has not been an easy class. I've struggled through a lot of
        the labs, but eventually figured them out. I'm involved in multiple sports like, Golf, 
        Basketball, and Baseball. I have lots of friends that help me with stuff
        and are always there for me when I need them.
