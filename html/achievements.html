        <p id="c">It was pretty cool for this to happen becasue me and two of my friends on the golf 
            team had placed in the top ten. I got 3rd place, and they got 8th and 9th. It was 
            pretty awsome to place that high because there were many of the higher ranked schools
            at the meet, and I managed to still place high.

        Through my life I have earned many trophies an other stuff, 
        but my most succesful sport happens to be golf. Through my High school
        I started paying golf, and to be honest when I started I was terrible.
        Although I have become pretty succesful in our program.

        <p id="freshman"> My Freshman year of high school I was thinking about quiting basketball, but my mom 
            made me try it one more time. Come to think of it I started to get really good at the game,
            and half way through my freshman year I had a talk with the head coach of the varsity team. After a 
            short conversation with the coach he said he was moving me up to varsity, and after hearing that
            Iv'e never thought about quiting since.

        Our home invite is always a hard meet to place in becasuse There are a lot of the suburb schools
        there, and all of them are very good at the sport. As the meet was starting to rap up I had saw 
        myself in the lead with just a couple of kids to turn there score cards in. Me and my team were 
        sitting there waiting, but as they were announcing the names they called my name for 2nd.
        I was happy with the finsh, but it always hurts when you lose by 1 shot knowing you could have
        fixed that on mistake.

        Every year to go to state every team has to go to a districts meet which determines
        which teams and individuals qualify. I had a really good chance to quaify this year, and
        worked hard all year for this moment. The round started off really well I was hitting some
        really good shots, and making smart plays. Although as the round went on I started to lose
        all my feel. The round had finally finshed, and they started to read of the names of the qualifiers.
        I had finally realized that I only lost by three and got third which really hurt me, because I
        knew that if I would've kept my attitude in check then I could've qualified.

            When I was 14, and about to go into my freshman year me and my friends had played Babe Ruth
            all summer to try and qualify for the Babe Ruth World Series. The Babe Ruth World Series
            are teams that can come from all over the united states. We made it to the final week and
            ended up placing thrid in the tournement. Us getting third meant we were the best Babe Ruth team
            ever from Ottumwa.
