    My Parents and I had talked about this for a long time and had finally come to senses
    on what would be the best fit for my future. For a long time know all I have been 
    dreaming about was to become a pilot that fly's either commercial or private. Also I 
    wanted to be able to play the sport Iv'e put a lot of hard work in, and that is golf. What's exciting
    is Dubuque offers me both of those things, and it is still relativley close to home.

        Dubuque is on my list becuase it is still some what close to home. I want to be able
        to go to college and have fun with what I'm studying, but still come out of school being 100%
        confident with being able to fly a plane. And that is what Dubuque offers me.

        Dubuque Univerity is well known for their avaition program. When I got into
        High School I wanted to be a pilot, but as you know things can change over the course of time.
        Around my Sophmore year I came up with a plan to go into the Computer Software Development Program.
        I had finally started the class, I shortly realized this wasn't for me. So I talked to my Uncle 
        who is a pilot, and he started to hep me get on track. With all of hos help he lead me to Dubuque 
        Uniiversity.

        I have been playing golf all of my life, and it is really exciting knowing that I get to play 
        the sport I have played all my life, and go to the college that best supports my future. The 
        Dubuque golf team has some solid players and I will have to try pretty hard to make the starting 
        roster. College golf is not easy, becasue you are traveling all of the time and you are  missing a 
        lot of school. Finally I choose Dubuque Universty becasue they give me the option to play the sport
        I desire and, they have the schooling I need to be succesful in my future.
